It was a little 2 storey building made of a material like bamboo, comprising of three separate rooms for students. The walls were full of gaps so it was pretty much open air. There was a mosquito net but after a few nights I started to wonder if it was even needed, tried sleeping one night without it and found I didn&#x27;t get any bites so I stopped using it.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="66"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="67"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918206221/in/set-72157646060932408" data-reactid="68"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14918206221-tiny-f42c764ba2.jpg" srcset="

Asking why about something specific that&#x27;s bothering you, and then having the high-level basic concept repeated at me more loudly and more slowly just made me frustrated and put me in a state where I didn&#x27;t seem to absorb any new information.</p><p data-reactid="94">My other grammar teacher suited me much better, although I feel that learning grammar in such a robotic way isn&#x27;t really ideal for me. There must be a better way, since I can speak English without really knowing the grammar.

Activities included things like visiting a nearby nature reserve, trips to nearby cities (Leon, Managua, Masaya, Granada), dinners out, visiting local volcanoes, a trip to the beach, horseback riding, a tour of an organic dried fruit processing plant, a visit to Laguna Apoyo and salsa classes.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="108"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="109"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14735363988/in/set-72157646060932408" data-reactid="110"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14735363988-tiny-0a2fd8c3d5.jpg" srcset="

It was great to see my comprehension progress each week and it was really interesting to learn about Nicaraguan history, and made visiting a lot of historic sites more interesting because I actually knew the stories behind them.</p><p data-reactid="120">About half way through the month I decided that staying at the school in the cabaña was letting me be lazy and speak too much English with other students, so I asked if I could move into a homestay.</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="121"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="122"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918977571/in/set-72157646060932408" data-reactid="123"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14918977571-tiny-75b5d7a1fb.jpg" srcset="

The area, San Juan de la Concepción, is in drought so they only have running water a few times per week, which mean that the toilet was flushed with buckets, and showers were also of the bucket variety. It&#x27;s amazing how little water you really need to get clean (although maybe I&#x27;d feel differently if I had long hair).</p><p data-reactid="133">Homestay food was a bit different than food at La Mariposa. Lots of beans and rice and chicken for dinner and eggs for breakfast. Nothing a bit of hot sauce can&#x27;t salvage, but I did miss all the healthy veggies I had gotten used to. I was glad that we still got lunch at the school, even in the homestay.</p><p data-reactid="134">Noise levels in town during the nights wasn&#x27;t quite as serene as at the school. It sounded like there were hundreds of dogs running around barking at each other every single night. Endlessly. All night.

I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d be much better after a month, but I&#x27;m much slower at learning spoken languages than I&#x27;m used to. With most other things, I feel like I only need to be shown a quick over view and I can figure out the rest, but with languages the way I think just doesn&#x27;t help. Too many exceptions to rules, and too many irregularities for me to just &quot;get a feel for it&quot;. It feels like I&#x27;m gonna have to ROTE learn a bunch of stuff if I&#x27;m ever going to get to where I want to be. Looking at it as a challenge for myself; I need to figure out something that works for me or I&#x27;ll bore myself to death with repetition :P</p><div class="flickrImage" data-reactid="148"><div class="flickrImage__container" data-reactid="149"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasthenomad/14918342771/in/set-72157646060932408" data-reactid="150"><img src="/assets/flickr/14/14918342771-tiny-5c395b34da.jpg" srcset="
